v1.12 26 Sep 2011
  * merged v1.10a and v1.11.

v1.11 28 Jun 2011 (bsquared and bchaffin)
  + "-y" command line option does all factoring with YAFU after trial division and rho
  + "-r <add_digits>" when used with -d or -c or both will ignore the max digit/composite
    limits if the sequence is decreasing or has the downdriver or a few other promising 
    patterns, and will increase the max digit/composite limit by <add_digits> if the
    sequence does not have a driver

v1.10a 01 May 2011
  + ecmpy option in .ini file to allow running ecm via an external python script

v1.10 25 Aug 2010
  + "-d <max_digits>" quits after sequence reaches <max_digits> digits.
  + "-c <max_cofactor>" quits after sequence passes ecm with a cofactor of 
    <max_cofactor> or more digits.
  + "-b" with -c and -d quits after a number meets both limits.
  + "-m <max_ecm_level>" ecm will only run to level <max_ecm_level> where 
    '1'=20-digit factor, '2'=25, etc.
  All updates in this version were done by Greebley.

v1.09 22 May 2010
  + "-t" quits aliqueit after verifying the elf file. Returns 1 if any error 
    (not warning) is detected, otherwise 0.
  + logs error and warning msgs during elf verification.
  + logs any encountered wrong factors.
  + logs cycle, merge and termination msgs.
  + logs the ecm curve # that found the factor. Thanks kar_bon.

v1.08 06 Jun 2009
  + "-q" quits aliqueit after factoring the first number.
  + detects bad factors (e.g. from recent yafu problem).
  + "-s <start>" submits the given sequence's elf file to Syd's DB, starting 
    with iteration <start>. You'll need wget to use this.
  + timestamps in log file. Thanks kar_bon.
  + handles up to sextic polynomials output by msieve.
  * only prime factors are considered "neat". Thanks 10metreh.

v1.07 13 Apr 2009
  + can resume from elf files with a partial last line.
  + added a simple Makefile for linux (g++).
  + <b1scale_*> and <b2scale_*> settings can be used to tune p-1/p+1/ecm work.
    B1 is multiplied by b1scale_*, and b2scale_* is passed to gmp-ecm using the 
    -B2scale arg. Note that b2scale=2 doesn't result in a B2 value twice as big 
    as with b2scale=1.
  * flushes stdout output for status messages. No difference on windows, but 
    linux seems to need it.
  * redirects msieve's stderr output when hiding.

v1.06 31 Mar 2009
  + uses msieve for gnfs poly-finding if <use_msieve_polyfind> is true.

v1.05 29 Mar 2009
  + prints the size of the starting composite for each line.
  + runs pollard rho (internal) right after the trial factoring. Nice speedup 
    for small numbers.
  + runs auto-increasing ecm forever instead of exiting if something goes wrong 
    and ggnfs fails to find a factor.
  + detects some malformed elf files instead of crashing while verifying... 
    Thanks Phil MjX.
  + "-h" prints a little help text on cmdline args.
  + logs cofactors explicitly.
  + the expressions used to determine maximum ecm level can now be customised 
    with <qs_k>, <qs_m>, <gnfs_k>, and <gnfs_m>.
  + "-p" runs aliqueit and all spawned processes at idle priority.

v1.04 22 Mar 2009
  + also does P-1/P+1 in addition to ecm using the gmp-ecm recommended 10*B1 
    for P-1 and 3x 5*B1 for P+1.
  + only saves relevant parts of the ecm log, or nothing at all if no factor 
    was found.
  + logs "*** c<digits> = <factor>" for found composite factors.
  + scans through the last 100KB of the log file when starting up and uses all 
    relevant factors it finds. Makes restarting easier as you no longer need to 
    manually specify factors with "-f" if you found them with the latest 
    aliqueit run.

v1.03 21 Mar 2009
  + cmdline arg "-e" skips ecm on the current iteration and goes straight to 
    qs/gnfs. Further iterations use ecm normally.
  + prints and logs a cheerful msg if an ecm factor >= <neat_factor_limit_ecm> 
    digits is found.
  + prints the size of the composite we're currently processing.
  * scientifies printed B1 values. 1000000 -> 1e6.
  * fixed a potential bug where we'd ecm forever ("ecm -c 0") or until we found 
    a factor. It never actually happened, but it could have if the ecm level 
    formulas had looked different.
  * changed the default <big_ecm_cutoff> to 65 instead of 70. This results in a 
    little more ecm being done for c65-c69.

v1.02 20 Mar 2009
  + much faster for small numbers, and probably faster for bigger numbers, i.e. 
    better ecm tuning.
  + compiles and runs under linux now. Thanks Ben.
  + detects when a sequence merges with an earlier sequence. 
    Setting "detect_merge = false" can be used to skip this, should you want 
    to try and hit the possibly imminent termination anyway.
  + hides yafu/msieve screen output for composites < <hide_output_limit> digits.
    Unwanted output is redirected to <null_device>.

v1.01 14 Mar 2009
  + logs sequence value to log file when starting to factor.
  + logs all found factors to log file.
  + detects cycles.
  * precalcs primes for trial factoring.
  * bugfix in cmdline argument parser.

v1.00 13 Mar 2009
  + initial release.
